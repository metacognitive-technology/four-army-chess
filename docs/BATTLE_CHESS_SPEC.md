# Battle Chess — Complete Application Specification

**Version:** 1.20.0  
**Purpose:** This document is a detailed, self-contained specification of the Battle Chess web application, written so that an AI code-generation system could reproduce the app identically.

---

## 1. High-Level Overview

Battle Chess is a full-stack, real-time multiplayer chess variant playable in a browser. It differs from standard chess in the following ways:

- **12×12 board** (instead of 8×8), with 8 columns of pieces centered using a 2-column offset on each side (columns 2–9 hold pieces; columns 0–1 and 10–11 are initially empty).
- **Piece movement is capped at 8 squares** for all sliding pieces (queen, rook, bishop).
- **Wall tiles** block all movement. Players may place walls on their own half during a pre-game **setup phase**.
- **Three special attacks** replace or supplement standard captures:
  - **Bishop: Arrow Attack** — ranged attack in any of 8 directions, resolved by a dice roll.
  - **Knight: Axe Attack** — melee attack on adjacent squares, resolved by a dice roll.
  - **Rook: Bomb** — destroys an adjacent wall tile, resolved by a dice roll.
  - **Rook: Wall Build** — creates a wall on an adjacent empty square, resolved by a dice roll.
- **Pawn combat** requires a successful dice roll to capture.
- **Configurable attack probabilities** — each attack type has a percentage chance of success, configurable in the lobby.
- **Per-piece attack limits** — bishops and rooks each have an individual cap (0–75) on special attacks.
- **Three game modes**: Player vs Player (PvP), Player vs Computer (PvC), Computer vs Computer (CvC).
- **Per-player budget assignment** — in "Individual" mode each player secretly assigns attack percentages within a shared budget before the game starts.
- **AI with minimax + alpha-beta pruning** at configurable depth (0–8 plies).
- **Persistent game state** saved to JSON files; games survive server restarts and can be resumed.
- **Attack statistics** — per-game min/avg/max counts for each special attack type, stored persistently.
- **Wall layout save/load** — named wall configurations shared across all players.

## 5. Board Layout and Piece Placement

### 5.1 Board Dimensions
- 12 rows × 12 columns, indexed [0..11][0..11].
- Row 0 is at the top (Black's back row). Row 11 is at the bottom (White's back row).
- Column labels: a–l (a = col 0, l = col 11), displayed in bottom-right corners of row 11 cells.
- Row labels: 1–12 displayed in top-left corners of col 0 cells (label = 12 – rowIndex).

### 5.2 Initial Piece Placement (offset = 2)
```
Row 0:  [empty][empty][b_rook_0][b_knight_1][b_bishop_2][b_queen_3][b_king_4][b_bishop_5][b_knight_6][b_rook_7][empty][empty]
Row 1:  [empty][empty][b_pawn_0][b_pawn_1]...[b_pawn_7][empty][empty]
Rows 2–9: All empty (wall placement zone for both sides).
Row 10: [empty][empty][w_pawn_0]...[w_pawn_7][empty][empty]
Row 11: [empty][empty][w_rook_0][w_knight_1][w_bishop_2][w_queen_3][w_king_4][w_bishop_5][w_knight_6][w_rook_7][empty][empty]
```
Back row order (columns 2–9): `rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook`

### 5.3 Piece IDs
Every piece gets a unique ID assigned at board creation:
- Format: `{colorInitial}_{type}_{indexInBackOrPawnRow}`
- Examples: `w_bishop_2`, `b_rook_7`, `w_pawn_0`
- IDs are used to track per-piece special attack usage counts.
- On promotion, the pawn keeps its original piece ID but its attack count resets to 0.

---

## 6. Movement Rules

### 6.1 General Rules
- **Walls** block all sliding movement and cannot be entered.
- **Maximum sliding distance**: 8 squares for queen, rook, bishop.
- **Captures**: Moving onto an enemy piece's square = capture (instant, no dice roll for non-pawn pieces).
- **King capture = game over** (not checkmate mechanics, though check/checkmate are also detected).

### 6.2 Piece Movement Details

| Piece | Movement |
|---|---|
| King | 1 square any direction. Supports **castling** (see §6.3). |
| Queen | Up to 8 squares in all 8 directions (sliding, blocked by walls/pieces). |
| Rook | Up to 8 squares horizontally or vertically (sliding). |
| Bishop | Up to 8 squares diagonally (sliding). |
| Knight | Standard L-shape (2+1). **Can leap over walls**. Only destination must be non-wall. |
| Pawn | 1 square in any of 8 directions (including diagonal). Captures require a dice roll (see §7.1). |

### 6.3 Castling
- King must not have moved (`hasMoved = false`).
- Rook must not have moved.
- Path between king and rook must be clear of pieces and walls.
- **Kingside**: King moves to column 11, rook (originally at col 9) moves to col 10.
- **Queenside**: King moves to column 0, rook (originally at col 2) moves to col 1.

### 6.4 Pawn Promotion
- A pawn reaching the opponent's back row (row 0 for white, row 11 for black) promotes.
- Human players see a promotion dialog; AI always promotes to queen.
- Promoted piece keeps the pawn's original piece ID; its special attack count resets to 0.

### 6.5 Check and Checkmate
- **Check**: King is attacked by an enemy piece (computed client-side and server-side).
- **Checkmate**: King is in check and no legal move escapes it.
- **Stalemate**: No legal moves available and king is not in check → draw.
- Moves that leave the king in check are filtered out (safe moves only shown as valid).

---

## 7. Special Attacks and Dice Mechanics

All attack probabilities are configured as **percentages** (0–100). When a percentage is set, the server rolls `Math.random() * 100 < percent` to determine success. The dice-roll fallback thresholds exist for legacy compatibility.

### 7.1 Pawn Attack
- **Trigger**: Pawn moves to a square occupied by an enemy piece.
- **Dice**: d6. Success if `roll <= pawnSuccessRoll` (or `Math.random()*100 < pawnAttackPercent`).
- **Failure**: Pawn stays in place; turn passes to opponent.
- **Animation**: Sword emoji (⚔️), yellow flash on attacker on failure; red flash on target on success.

### 7.2 Bishop Arrow Attack
- **Trigger**: Player clicks selected bishop → clicks arrow button → clicks a highlighted target square.
- **Range**: Any of 8 directions, stopping at walls; unlimited range (up to 12 squares).
- **Target**: Must be an enemy piece in line of sight (no wall between).
- **Dice**: 2d6 (shown as d4 in code for animation). Success if `Math.random()*100 < bishopAttackPercent`.
- **Success**: Enemy piece removed.
- **Failure**: No movement; turn passes.
- **Limit**: Each individual bishop has a shared pool tracked by `specialAttackCounts[piece.id]`. Maximum = `maxBishopAttacks` (0–75, default 10).
- **Animation**: Arrow emoji (🏹), orange glow.

### 7.3 Knight Axe Attack
- **Trigger**: Player clicks selected knight → clicks axe button → clicks a highlighted adjacent square.
- **Target**: Any enemy piece in the 8 adjacent squares (not walls).
- **Dice**: d6. Success if `roll >= knightMinRoll` (or `Math.random()*100 < knightAttackPercent`).
- **Failure**: Turn passes.
- **Animation**: Axe emoji (🪓), purple glow.

### 7.4 Rook Bomb Attack
- **Trigger**: Player clicks selected rook → clicks bomb button → clicks a highlighted adjacent wall square.
- **Target**: Any of the 8 adjacent squares that are walls.
- **Dice**: d10. Success if `Math.random()*100 < bombAttackPercent`.
- **Success**: Target wall tile is removed (`isWall = false`).
- **Failure**: Wall stays; turn passes.
- **Limit**: Shared with wall build per piece. Each rook tracks `specialAttackCounts[piece.id]` against `maxRookAttacks` (0–75, default 10).
- **Animation**: Bomb emoji (💣), red glow.

### 7.5 Rook Wall Build Attack
- **Trigger**: Player clicks selected rook → clicks build button → clicks a highlighted adjacent empty square.
- **Target**: Any of the 8 adjacent squares that have no piece and no wall.
- **Dice**: d10. Success if `Math.random()*100 < wallBuildPercent`.
- **Success**: Target square becomes a wall (`isWall = true`).
- **Failure**: Turn passes.
- **Limit**: Same pool as bomb (`specialAttackCounts[piece.id]` vs `maxRookAttacks`).
- **Animation**: Brick emoji (🧱), cyan glow.

### 7.6 Attack Failure Popup
- When any special attack fails, after 600 ms a **red tooltip popup** appears above the target square.
- Text: `"Missed! ({roll})"` for arrow/axe, `"Failed! ({roll})"` for bomb/wall build/pawn.
- Popup disappears after 2 seconds.
- No toast notification is used for attack results (only the popup).

### 7.7 Per-Piece Attack Limit Badges
- When a bishop or rook is selected AND arrow/bomb/wall-build mode is active, a **small circular badge** appears in the top-right corner of each bishop or rook square (for the current player's pieces).
- Badge color: **blue** (many remaining), **orange** (≤ 2 remaining), **red** (exhausted, 0 remaining).
- Badge shows the remaining count as a number.
- When exhausted, the attack buttons display "0" with gray background and cannot be clicked.

## 8. Game Phases and Flow

```
[Lobby] → createGame / joinGame
    │
    ├── budgetMode === 'individual' AND 2 players joined → 'budget_setup'
    │       ↓ both submit budgets
    │
    ├── maxWallsPerPlayer > 0 → 'setup'
    │       ↓ both players click Ready
    │
    └── → 'playing'
            ↓ king captured / checkmate / stalemate / resign / draw accepted
         → 'finished'
```

### 8.1 Waiting Phase
- Game is created. Creator sees Game ID and a "Share Game Link" button.
- Opponent joins via URL `/?game={gameId}` or by entering the ID.
- Creator is always White; joiner is always Black.

### 8.2 Budget Setup Phase (Individual Mode Only)
- Both players independently see a budget panel with 5 sliders:
  - Pawn Attack %, Bishop Arrow %, Knight Axe %, Rook Bomb %, Rook Wall Build %.
- **Total attack budget** is set by the game creator (default 250%).
- Sliders are clamped so the sum cannot exceed the budget.
- Used / Remaining counters shown in real time.
- Player clicks "Submit Budget". Server validates total ≤ budget, then stores `whiteAttackSettings` / `blackAttackSettings`.
- After both players (or AI) submit, game advances to setup or playing phase.

### 8.3 Setup Phase (Wall Placement)
- Each player places walls on their own half of the board.
- White's half: rows 6–11. Black's half: rows 0–5.
- Walls can be toggled (click placed wall to remove it and recover the count).
- **Controls available**:
  - "Place N Walls Randomly" button — fills remaining slots randomly on own half.
  - "Generate Maze Pattern" button — creates a maze-like pattern on own half.
  - "Wall Layouts" panel — save/load named wall configurations.
  - "Ready to Play" button — locks in the player's walls.
- During setup, only own-half squares are highlighted (ring highlight with `ring-4 ring-inset ring-gray-500`) to indicate clickable placement zones.
- Opponent's walls are hidden until the game starts (walls outside own half not shown in setup phase).

### 8.4 Playing Phase
- Standard turn-based play; `currentTurn` alternates.
- Turn indicator: a bold arrow (← or →) with color name slides to left (black's turn) or right (white's turn).
- AI thinking indicator: pulsing Brain icon with "Thinking... Ply X/Y" text.
- CvC takeover buttons: "Play White" / "Play Black" appear during CvC games.

### 8.5 Finished Phase
- Winner banner displayed.
- Sound effect played (victory fanfare for winner, defeat sound for loser).
- "New Game" button returns to lobby.

---

## 9. Game Modes

### 9.1 Player vs Player (PvP)
- Two human players. Creator = white, joiner = black.
- Black player's board is **visually flipped** (rotated 180°) so both players see their pieces at the bottom.
- Board flip is applied to: board rendering, attack animation overlay positions, click handling (logical positions always row/col 0–11 regardless of flip).
- Shareable URL: `{origin}/?game={gameId}`.

### 9.2 Player vs Computer (PvC)
- Creator plays White; AI plays Black automatically.
- AI places its walls randomly in its half during setup.
- After human clicks "Ready", game starts (AI is always ready).
- AI uses minimax with alpha-beta pruning at configured depth.
- Player can hand off their turn to the AI ("Hand Off to AI" button), then reclaim ("Take Control" button).
- In individual budget mode, AI auto-generates budget settings using weighted distribution.

### 9.3 Computer vs Computer (CvC)
- Created via REST POST `/api/games/cvc`.
- Both sides played by AI; moves happen every 500 ms (1500 ms for special attacks).
- Human observers watch the game in real time via WebSocket.
- "Pause" / "Resume" button available.
- "Play White" / "Play Black" takeover buttons convert CvC → PvC or PvP.
- CvC games in the saved games list show "White" and "Black" takeover buttons.

## 10. AI System

### 10.1 Architecture
- Runs server-side in `GameManager`.
- **A* pathfinding** with Chebyshev distance heuristic (8-directional) for navigating around walls.
  - Results cached per wall configuration (cache invalidated when walls change).
  - Max iterations: `BOARD_SIZE * BOARD_SIZE * 2 = 288`.
- **Minimax with alpha-beta pruning** for depths 1–8.
  - Depth 0: heuristic scoring only (original fast behavior).
  - Each ply: server emits `aiThinkingPly` / `aiThinkingMaxPly` to clients.
- **Board evaluation heuristic**:
  - Material values: pawn=1, knight/bishop=3, rook=5, queen=9, king=100.
  - Central control bonus, pawn advancement scoring.
  - A* path distance to enemy king (shorter = better).

### 10.2 AI Move Selection
1. Gather all legal moves for current color.
2. Score each move.
3. Sort descending by score; pick randomly from top 3.
4. If in check, filter to check-escaping moves only.

### 10.3 AI Special Attack Scoring
- **Arrow**: Score based on material value of target × 10 × 0.5 + random noise; only when bishop attack limit not reached.
- **Axe**: Same material-value scoring.
- **Bomb**: Base score 350. Bonuses: heavily walled (+150), 3+ blocked pieces (+200), opens path to enemy king (+25 per step, +500 if was Infinity), helps other pieces (+40–150 each).
- AI does **not** use wall build (only bomb and arrow/axe).

### 10.4 AI Wall Placement
- **PvC**: AI places walls randomly in its half during `createGame`.
- **CvC**: Walls placed randomly for both sides via `placeCvCWalls`.
- **Maze generation**: Server-side algorithm for human players (handles `setup_random_walls` with maze option).

### 10.5 AI Budget (Individual Mode)
- AI budget is auto-generated using fixed weights: `[1, 3, 3, 1, 2]` for `[pawn, bishop, knight, bomb, wallBuild]`.
- Weights divide the total budget proportionally, capped at 100% each.

## 11. WebSocket Protocol

### 11.1 Connection
- Client connects to `ws://{host}/ws`.
- No auth token; `playerId` is sent in message payloads.
- Player IDs stored in `localStorage` as `playerId_{gameId}`.

### 11.2 Client → Server Messages

### 11.4 State Filtering
In **individual budget mode**, `filterStateForPlayer()` is called before sending state to each player:
- Hides opponent's `whiteAttackSettings` / `blackAttackSettings`.
- Merges the player's own per-player settings into the top-level `attackSettings` field.
- Ensures each player only sees their own attack percentages.

- When a game ends (`state.winner` is set), `flushGameStats()` is called exactly once (tracked by `flushedGameIds` Set).
- Stats are computed on-the-fly from the array: min, avg (rounded to 1 decimal), max.

### 13.3 Wall Layouts
- Location: `server/data/layouts.json`
- Format: `Array<{ name: string; walls: Position[] }>`.
- Shared across all users (any user can see, save, or delete any layout).
- Upsert by name (POST creates or replaces existing layout with same name).

## 14. Frontend Architecture

### 14.1 Single Route
- `App.tsx` registers one route: `/` → `<Game />`.
- No navigation sidebar; the entire app is a single page.

### 14.2 `useWebSocket` Hook
Central hook managing:
- WebSocket connection, reconnect logic (exponential backoff).
- `gameState: GameState | null`
- `playerId: string | null` — persisted in localStorage.
- `playerColor: PlayerColor | null`
- `connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'connecting'`
- `isObserver: boolean` — true when watching a CvC game without player role.
- `pendingPromotion: Position | null` — set when server sends `needsPromotion`.
- Functions: `createGame`, `joinGame`, `reconnectGame`, `takeoverGame`, `watchCvCGame`, `pauseCvCGame`, `offerDraw`, `respondToDraw`, `submitBudget`, `sendMessage`.
- Callbacks: `onDrawOffered`, `onDrawResponse`.

### 14.3 `Game.tsx` — Lobby View

## 22. Lobby Configuration Details

### 22.1 Attack Budget System
- **Total Attack Budget**: A pool of percentage points (e.g. 250) shared across all 5 attack types.
- Each attack type has an independent percentage (0–100).
- Sum of all percentages must not exceed the budget.
- **Shared mode**: Creator sets percentages; both players use same settings.
- **Individual mode**: Both players configure secretly during `budget_setup` phase.

### 22.2 Conversion from Percentage to Roll Thresholds
```
pawnSuccessRoll = round(pawnAttackPercent / 100 * 6)    // d6, roll-under
knightMinRoll   = 7 - round(knightAttackPercent / 100 * 6)   // d6, roll-at-least
bombSuccessRoll = round(bombAttackPercent / 100 * 10)   // d10, roll-under
wallBuildRoll   = round(wallBuildPercent / 100 * 10)    // d10, roll-under
```

### 22.3 Configurable Defaults
| Setting | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Max walls per player | 8 | 0–32 |
| Total attack budget | 250% | 0–500% |
| Pawn attack % | 17% | 0–100% |
| Bishop arrow % | 50% | 0–100% |
| Knight axe % | 50% | 0–100% |
| Rook bomb % | 10% | 0–100% |
| Rook wall build % | 50% | 0–100% |
| Max bishop attacks | 10 | 0–75 |
| Max rook attacks | 10 | 0–75 |
| AI depth | 0 | 0–8 |
| Budget mode | shared | shared / individual |

---

## 23. Dark Mode

- Implemented via Tailwind's `darkMode: ['class']` + `.dark` class on `<html>`.
- All colors use CSS variables defined in `index.css` under `:root` and `.dark`.
- Board uses explicit dark variants: `dark:bg-green-600` / `dark:bg-green-500`.
- No toggle in the UI; follows system preference or manual class.

---

## 24. Responsive / Mobile Support

- Single-column stacked layout on screens narrower than `lg` (1024px).
- On mobile: board appears first (order-1), then black panel (order-2), then white/controls (order-3).
- Game Rules accordion hidden on desktop (shown in left panel); visible at bottom of center column on mobile.
- Board width: `min(90vw, calc(100vh - 280px), 560px)` adapts to viewport.
- Zoom controls allow manual zoom from 60% to 200%.
- Card padding uses `p-2 sm:p-4` / `p-3 sm:p-6` responsive variants.

## 26. Key Implementation Notes

1. **No database for games**: All game state uses JSON files. The PostgreSQL database only stores the `users` table (not currently used in active features).

2. **Piece ID stability**: IDs are assigned at board creation and never change (even through promotion). This is critical for the per-piece attack count tracking.

3. **AI concurrency**: CvC games use `setInterval` style scheduling (scheduleNext recursively calls setTimeout). The interval is stored in `cvcIntervals` map and cleaned up on game end or takeover.

4. **A* cache invalidation**: The cache key is a stringified wall-position hash. Cache clears whenever a wall is added or removed (bomb, wall build, or new wall during setup).

5. **Special attack counting**: Both bomb and wall build use the same `maxRookAttacks` limit and the same `specialAttackCounts[piece.id]` counter per rook. So a rook's combined bomb + wall build attempts are counted together.

6. **`flushedGameIds` Set**: Prevents double-recording stats if `saveGame` is called multiple times after a winner is set (e.g., from both the game-ending move handler and a subsequent reconnect save).

7. **Board flip and attack animations**: The `AttackAnimationOverlay` uses `boardRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()` to compute pixel positions. It flips logical row/col to display row/col when `shouldFlipBoard` is true.

8. **`select-none` + `caretColor: transparent`**: Applied to the board container to prevent text selection highlight and blinking cursor artifact on mobile/desktop browsers.

9. **Reconnection flow**: If a player navigates away and returns, `localStorage` contains `playerId_{gameId}`. The client sends a `reconnect` message; the server loads the game from file if not in memory and re-associates the WebSocket.

10. **`GAME_VERSION` constant**: Located at the top of `Game.tsx`. Must be updated on every code change. Displayed in the lobby card header as a small badge (`v{GAME_VERSION}`).
